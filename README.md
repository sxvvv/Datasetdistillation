# Dataset Distillation for Image Deraining

Welcome to the Dataset Distillation project, specifically designed to address the problem of image deraining. This project aims to improve the efficiency of deep learning models by distilling large-scale datasets into compact, representative training datasets, without compromising the quality of the output.
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach for dataset distillation applied to the problem of removing rain artifacts from images. The current version includes pretrained models and provides the necessary tools to perform efficient dataset distillation, making the training of deraining models computationally lighter and faster while maintaining high visual quality.

The pretrained deraining models can be found here: [Pre-trained Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wuMb-J75EK2PlmclMQDeXBSIAAdyKOT1?usp=drive_link).

## Features
- **Pre-trained Models**: Access high-quality, pre-trained models that provide state-of-the-art deraining performance.
- **Dataset Distillation Framework**: Leverages dataset distillation techniques to create compact and efficient datasets for deraining tasks.
- **Easy Integration**: The project is designed to integrate smoothly with your existing image restoration pipelines.
